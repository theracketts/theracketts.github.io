			<p>Band started (sort of!) in early 1998, with a few guys getting together to play for an hour once a week – guitars, drums, and keyboard. All had an attachment to Alcester Grammar School, Warwickshire (staff x two, parents of students x four, and ex-pupil x one).</p>

			<p>Truly appalling initially, but we were never going to play in public, surely! Parents Association asked us to do a gig, and frantic learning of seventeen songs led to a School PA gig in the November.</p>

			<p>A pretty shoddy, but enthusiastic, performance led to the odd charity gig, and regular practice made the performance acceptable. Still together,  now playing fine music, although some personnel changes, with a dozen or so gigs a year, mostly charity based.</p>

			<p>The total amount raised for charity so far is about £40,000+</p>
